# [Examples](#examples)

## [Device Setup(RH-P12-RN(A))](#device-setuprh-p12-rna)
In order to run the example, RH-P12-RN(A) should be set as belows.

- ID = 1
- Baudrate = 2 Mbps

**TIP**: To change the values of the control table, use [R+ Manager 2.0] (in Windows) or [DYNAMIXEL Wizard 2.0] (in Windows, Linux or Mac OS.)
{: .notice--success}

## [Communication Port Setup](#communication-port-setup)
The Serial COM Port for Windows example is set as "**COM4**".  
Please change the Serial COM Port to COM4 in the Device Manager or modify the DEVICE_NAME in the example source code.  
In case of Linux example, the communication port is set as "**/dev/ttyUSB0**".  
If other communication port is used, the DEVICE_NAME in the example source code should be modified properly.

> RH-P12-RN_Example/rh-p12-rna.cpp

```cpp
...

#if defined(__linux__)
#define DEVICE_NAME             "/dev/ttyUSB0"
#elif defined(_WIN32) || defined(_WIN64)
#define DEVICE_NAME             "COM4"
#endif

...
```

{: .notice}

### Build and Run

1. Install Visual Studio program.

    The Windows example is tested on Visual Studio 2017
    {: .notice} 

2. Open the solution with `RH-P12-RN_Example\win64\RH-P12-RN-Example.sln` file.

3. Build solution and run.    
  - Below error message might appear due to the difference of Windows SDK version.
    ```
    error MSB8036: The Windows SDK version 10.0.14393.0 was not found.  
    Install the required version of Windows SDK or change the SDK version  
    in the project property pages or by right-clicking the solution  
    and selecting "Retarget solution".
    ```
    In order to resolve the error, open the property page from the project and select **installed Windows SDK version**, then rebuild the code.

### [Execution Screen](#execution-screen)

If execution fails, confirm the error message and proceed to [Device Setup(RH-P12-RN(A))](#device-setuprh-p12-rna) or [Communication Port Setup](#communication-port-setup) properly.

- Upon successful execution of the Windows example, the communication port and the baudrate of connected device are listed as shown in the below image. 
  ![img](/assets/images/platform/rh_p12_rn/windows_example_execute.png)

- If RH-P12-RN is configured as **Current-based Position Control Mode**, below image will be displayed.  
  ![img](/assets/images/platform/rh_p12_rn/windows_example_position_mode.png)

- If RH-P12-RN is configured as **Current Control Mode**, below image will be displayed.  
  ![img](/assets/images/platform/rh_p12_rn/windows_example_current_mode.png)

#### [Operation](#operation)

Refer to the images (Current-based Position Control Mode and Current Control Mode) at [Execution Screen](#execution-screen).

* Use `↑` / `↓` key of your keyboard to move a previous/next option.
* Use `Space` key to check/uncheck options in the MODE / TORQUE / CONTROL menu.  
* Shortcut keys in the parenthesis(`C`,`P`,`T`,`O`,`L`,`A`) can check/uncheck options.
* In order to change PARAMETERS value, `[` and `]` keys increase/decrease by 1 whereas `{` and `}` keys increase/decrease by 10.  

Each option is described as belows.

`++ MODE ++`
* (C) current control mode : Current Control Mode is used when checked
* (P) current based position control mode : Current-based Position Control Mode is used when checked

`++ TORQUE ++`
* (T) torque ON / OFF : Enable Torque when checked, Disable Torque when unchecked

`++ CONTROL ++`
* (O) Open : Open the gripper when checked, and check will be cleared automatically.
* (L) Close : Close the gripper when checked, and check will be cleared automatically.
* (A) Open & Close auto repeat : Repeat open and close motion when checked.
* (G) go to goal position : goal position in the PARAMETERS will be applied immediately when checked.

`++ PARAMETERS ++`
* goal PWM : Setting value will be written in the goal PWM address of the RH-P12-RN.
* goal current : Setting value will be written in the goal PWM address of the RH-P12-RN.
* goal velocity : Setting value will be written in the goal velocity address of the RH-P12-RN.
* goal position : Setting value will be written in the goal position address of the RH-P12-RN when **(G) go to goal position** is checked.

## [Linux Example](#linux-example)

Follow the steps to operate RH-P12-RN(A) by using Linux Example. **Enter the given commands** using Terminal.
