## [Search Variables/Functions](#search-variablesfunctions)

This is a feature to find the location where a variable or function has been used. It provides the option to change the name of each variable or function.

1. Click the "Variable (or Function)" button on the right. (There must be at least one variable or function.)
2. Select the target that you wish to find reference in the "Variables list (or Functions list)"
3. You can check the locations at which the selected variable (or function) has been used in the “Reference Results” field

## [Grammar/Compile Check](#grammarcompile-check)

In order to download the task code to the controller, it must go through a grammar check and compile process. If you try to download to the controller or click the "Error" button, it will run the grammar check and compile process automatically.

- **Grammar Check** : This is the process of examining whether the instructions used in the task code are compatible instructions with the controller, and whether there are any errors in the grammar.  
  All errors must be corrected before it can move on to the next step.
- **Compilation** : This is the process of converting the code that has finished grammar check into a machine language that the controller can interpret.  
  The number of variables, callback usage, and memory usage are examined during the compilation process.

## [Create Custom Robot](#create-custom-robot)

1. Move to the Home tab and select the controller to use, and click on the `Add Joint` button.  
  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/motion_user_01.png)  

2. Select the type of joint (motor) to use and set its ID. Click `Apply` to add the joint to the joint list.  
  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/motion_user_02.png)  
  ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/motion_user_03.png)  

3. Once the joint list is completed and the new project is created, the custom robot will be shown on the screen.  
  Since it is difficult to analogize and display the actual custom robot on the 3D model, it will be helpful if the users frequently playback the motion on the actual robot (Sync Mode) to check on their status.

    ![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/motion_copy_04.png)

**NOTE** Multiple R+ Task 3.0 can be run to copy and paste the motions.
{: .notice--info}

{% capture motion_01 %}
**CAUTION** : When copying data between Motion files
- Data that can be copied : joint value, Key-Frame, Motion Unit, and Motion.
- If a data with the same name already exists in the new (blank) project, the data will not copy.
- Copying must be proceeded in the order of Motion Unit -> Motion. If a Motion is copied without copying any Motion Units, an empty Motion will be pasted.
{% endcapture %}
