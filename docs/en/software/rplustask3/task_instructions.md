![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_043.png)

### [Conditional Clause](#conditional-clause)

- A conditional clause returns the computation result as either true or false.
- Below are the comparison operators that can be used inside the parenthesis.

| Operators | Description                                                                     |
|:---------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    ==     | The value on the left hand side is equal to the right hand side                 |
|    !=     | The value on the left hand side is not equal to the right hand side             |
|    \>     | The value on the left hand side is greater than the right hand side             |
|    \>=    | The value on the left hand side is greater than or equal to the right hand side |
|     <     | The value on the left hand side is less than the right hand side                |
|    <=     | The value on the left hand side is less than or equal to the right hand side    |

More than one condition can be examined as shown below.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_044.png)

- When using multiple conditional clauses, the following logical operators can be used.

| Logical Operators |                                              Description                                              |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|       then        |                               Do not use additional conditional clause.                               |
|        &&         | Use logical AND operation for two conditions. Both conditions must be true for the result to be true. |
|         \         | Use logical OR operation for two conditions. Either condition must be true for the result to be true. |

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_045.png)

### [If](#if)

- If the conditional clause is true, the code inside the `IF` block is executed.

The following is an example of turning the LED on if the variable in the `IF` statement is equal to 100.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_046.png)

Begin / End Blocks can be omitted when there's only one instruction in the block.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_047.png)

### [Else If](#else-if)

- This is used to examine another conditional clause when `IF` statement is false.
- `ELSE IF` block must be used after `IF` block or another `ELSE IF` block.

The following is an example of using `IF` and `ELSE IF` statements.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_048.png)

Begin / End Blocks can be omitted when there's only one instruction in the block.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_049.png)

### [Else](#else)

- If neither `IF` nor `ELSE IF` statement are true, `ELSE` block will be executed.
- The `ELSE` block must be used after `IF` or `ELSE IF` block.

The following is an example of using `IF`, `ELSE IF`, and `ELSE` blocks.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_050.png)

Begin / End Blocks can be omitted when there's only one instruction in the block.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_051.png)

## [Loop](#loop)

This instruction is used when the program needs to repeat a specific behavior or to run an instruction multiple times.  
The Loop blocks can be configured in various ways by setting a specific condition.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_052.png)

### [Endless Loop](#endless-loop)

- The code in the `ENDLESS LOOP` block will repeatedly be executed.
- The `BREAK LOOP` instruction can be used to end the repetition.

The following is an example of using Endless Loop to print the number 100 on the screen. The `Print Screen with Line` command is placed in the `ENDLESS LOOP` block.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_053.png)

Begin / End Blocks can be omitted when there's only one instruction in the block.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_054.png)

### [Loop While](#loop-while)

- The code in the `LOOP WHILE` block will repeatedly be executed as long as the condition meets.
- Just like the `Condition` instructions, multiple conditional clauses can be combined.
- The `BREAK LOOP` instruction can be used to end the repetition.

The following is an example of using `LOOP WHILE` to print the number 100 on the screen for 1.024 seconds.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_055.png)

The following is an example of using `LOOP WHILE` and a variable to print the number 100 for 10 times.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_056.png)

### [Loop For](#loop-for)

- This instruction will execute the `LOOP FOR` block for a specified number of times.
- Each time the program runs through the block, the variable will be increased by 1.
- The `BREAK LOOP` instruction can be used to end the repetition.
- The condition can be described as **( Repeat counter variable = Starting Value ~ End Value )**. Therefore, the block will be repeated for **End Value - Starting Value + 1** times.

The following is an example of using Loop For to print the number 100 on the screen 10 times.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_057.png)

The following is an example of multiplying the **Repeat counter variable** by 100 and print on the screen. As the Repeat counter variable increases, the printed value will also be increased by 100; 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_058.png)

### [Wait While](#wait-while)

- This instruction will stop running the code while the specific condition meets.

The following is an example of using `WAIT WHILE` with a **Timer** to hold the program running for 1.024 seconds.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_059.png)

The following is an example of using `WAIT WHILE` with a **Motion Status** to wait until the motion completes.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_061.png)

### [Break Loop](#break-loop)

- This instruction will exit the loop block.
- This instruction can only be used within `ENDLESS LOOP`, `LOOP WHILE`, and `LOOP FOR` blocks.

The following is an example of using `BREAK LOOP` to exit the loop when the remote controller data is arrived. After exiting the block, followed by code will be executed.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_062.png)

## [Function(Sub-Routine)](#functionsub-routine)

If a specific code is used repeatedly, or if you wish to classify an area of code as a unit that performs a specific behavior, you can group the lines of code as a Function.
Refer to the following figure for details.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_063.png)

### [Function/Call](#functioncall)

- When the same code is used in different locations in the program, such code can be defined within a `FUNCTION` block.
- An adequate use of functions will make the code concise and easy to read.
- A function that has been created can be used with “Call” instruction when needed.
- Functions must be written outside of the main program routine.
- In task, functions cannot configure input or output arguments

The following is an example of making the action of blinking the LED as a function and using it.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_064.png)

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_065.png)

Functions cannot call itself within the same function.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_066.png)

### [Return](#return)

- This instruction is used for exiting a function while it is being executed.
- It can only be used inside a regular function and callback function.

The following is an example of a function being executed until the end without using Return.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_067.png)

The following is an example of a function being executed but encountering Return in the middle of executing the function, which will make the program exit the function.

![](/assets/images/sw/rplus_task3/task3_068.png)

### [Callback](#callback)

- This function is executed independently from the main program routine, executing itself periodically
- Callback functions must be written outside of the main program routine.
- Because it is not allowed to write code within a callback that takes too much time to execute, callback has restrictions in the use of Loops / Variables / Parameter Calls / volume of code.
- The following restrictions must be applied when using a callback function.
  - Loops, Labels, Jumps, Calls are not allowed in the Callback
  - Communication with an external device is limited to a maximum of 2 times
  - The code size of callback function cannot exceed 512 bytes

The following is an example of using the callback function to receive wireless data and save it to the variable “received data”.
