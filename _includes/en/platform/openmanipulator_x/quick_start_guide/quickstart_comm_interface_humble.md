</summary>

#### Connection
Connect micro USB (connected to PC), DYNAMIXEL's(OpenMANIPULATOR-X), and 12V Power to U2D2 and U2D2 power hub board as shown below.

#### USB Latency Timer Setting
In Linux(Ubuntu platform) environment, USB latency time is set to 16ms by default. Follow the steps below to set the communication latency time to the lowest value (1ms) between DYNAMIXEL's and PC connected via USB.

Open a terminal window and enter the following command to set usb latency time. The command below will set the USB latency to **1 ms**.

**TIP**: You can open a new terminal window by pressing `CTRL` + `ALT` + `T`.
{: .notice}

``` bash
$ ros2 run open_manipulator_x_bringup create_udev_rules
```

{% capture notice_01 %}
**TIP**: If you would like to see the current latency, enter the following command in the terminal.  

```bash
$ cat /sys/bus/usb-serial/devices/ttyUSB0/latency_timer
```

![](/assets/images/icon_unfold.png) **Option 2 : Use OpenCR as a communication interface**
</summary>

This section describes how to set up OpenCR as a communication board between **ROS Packages** of PC and DYNAMIXEL's of OpenMANIPULATOR-X.  

#### Connection

Connect micro USB (connected to PC), DYNAMIXEL's(OpenMANIPULATOR-X), and 12V Power to OpenCR as shown below.

#### Upload Source code

1. Set up the Arduino IDE for OpenCR ([Instructions](/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/#arduino-ide))

2. Connect OpenCR to the PC.

3. Open the example from `File > Examples > OpenCR > 10.Etc > usb_to_dxl`  
  ![](/assets/images/platform/openmanipulator_x/OpenManipulator_opencr_utd_setup.png)  
  > Open the `usb to dxl` example.

4. Upload the example to OpenCR.

If upload fails, try with [Recovery Mode](/docs/en/parts/controller/opencr10/#recovery-mode)
1. Turn on the power of the OpenCR board.
2. Hold down the `PUSH SW2` button.
3. Press the `Reset` button.
4. Release the `Reset` button.
5. Release the `PUSH SW2` button.

The STATUS LED should blink every 100ms after entering Recovery Mode successfully.
