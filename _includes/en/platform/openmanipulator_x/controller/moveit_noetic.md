Also, you can use MoveIt feature using your virtual robot in the Gazebo enviroment with the following command.

For more information on Gazebo, See [Simulation](/docs/en/platform/openmanipulator_x/ros_simulation/)

1. Launch Gazebo simulator and RViz visualization tool
```bash
$ roslaunch open_manipulator_controllers joint_trajectory_controller.launch
```

2. Click on Play `â–¶` button at the bottom of the Gazebo simulator.
