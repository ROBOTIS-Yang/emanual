To use `turtlebot3_fake_node`, you need the `turtlebot3_simulation` metapackage. Install the package as shown in the following command.

**TIP**: The terminal application can be found with the Ubuntu search icon on the top left corner of the screen. The shortcut key for running the terminal is `Ctrl`-`Alt`-`T`.
{: .notice--success}

**NOTE**: The `turtlebot3_simulation` metapackage requires `turtlebot3` metapackage and `turtlebot3_msgs` package as a prerequisite. If you didn't install it in the [Install Dependent ROS Packages of PC Setup][pc_setup] section, install it first.
{: .notice--info}  
**[Remote PC]**  
```bash
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git cloneÂ -b noetic https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
```

To launch the virtual robot, execute the `turtlebot3_fake.launch` file in the `turtlebot3_fake` package as shown below. The `turtlebot3_fake` is a very simple simulation node that can be run without having an actual robot. You can even control the virtual TurtleBot3 in RViz with a teleoperation node.

Please use the proper keyword among `burger`, `waffle`, `waffle_pi` for the `TURTLEBOT3_MODEL` parameter.  
**[Remote PC]**  
```bash
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_fake turtlebot3_fake.launch
```  
**[Remote PC]**  
```bash
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_teleop turtlebot3_teleop_key.launch
```
