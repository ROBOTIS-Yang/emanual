The PWM Limit(36) is used to configure the maximum allowable PWM output. [Goal PWM(100)] canâ€™t be set to a values exceeding the [PWM Limit(36)]. Additionaly, the [PWM Limit(36)] is used in all operating mode as an absolute limit to the motor's final output PWM. For more details, please refer to the Gain section of each operating mode.
