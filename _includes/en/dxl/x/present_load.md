Present Load reports an estimate of the current load applied to the motor's output.

| Unit  | Value Range   | Description |
| :---: | :-----------: | :---: |
| 0.1%  | -1,000 ~ 1,000| Positive(CCW Load), Negative(CW Load) |

**NOTE** : The Present load is an inferred value based on the internal output value; and is not measured using a torque sensor, etc. Therefore, it may be inaccurate for precise measuring of weight or torque. It is recommended to use it only for predicting and monitoring the direction and size of forces being applied to the servo.
